# SubVoxel-QSM-Atlas
Paper:

This is the official repository for the sub-voxel QSM Atlas. The repository contains sub-voxel quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) atlases in MNI space. The longitudinal and age-specific atlases can provide a standard coordinate space and efficient segmentation tool for sub-region delineation. All files are in NIfTI format.

## Contents
The repository contains the following files and directories:

(1) **/longitudinal**: This directory contains the longitudinal atlas of QSM, paramagnetic susceptibility mapping (Xpara) and diamagnetic susceptibility mapping (Xdia).

(2) **/age-specific**: This directory contains the age-specific atlas of QSM, Xpara and Xdia.
